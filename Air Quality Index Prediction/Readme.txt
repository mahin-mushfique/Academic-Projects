This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the cities with the worst air quality globally. Using machine learning, specifically PM2.5 concentration data from 2022 and 2023, we implement various algorithms with the Scikit-learn library to classify air quality categories. The project also utilizes Explainable AI (LIME) for result visualization and employs SMOTE to balance class distribution. The highest cross-validation scores were achieved using XGBoost (84.9%) and K-Nearest Neighbor (82.6%). This work aims to address the serious health risks posed by air pollution in densely populated urban areas.
